			<p>Hello everybody, I am Amaury de La Tribouille, a 18 years old student. I am a first year student who lives in Argenteuil in Val d'Oise. I study at the <a href="https://www.essec.edu/en/" target="_blank">ESSEC Business School</p>

			<h2>MY ASSOCIATION</h2>
			<p> I'm currently a member of one association in ESSEC : Comedia. That's a drama association in which we play some plays at the end of the year after many many training. I love this association because I found a lot of friends there and we are like a family, so everytime I am going to a training I have the simle because I know that this evening gonna be so good. I play 3 times the same play in the 13th,14th and on the 20th June.<p/>

			<h2>TRAVEL</h2>
			<p> I love discovering new landscapes around the world. I especially love countries that offer many different cultures within a small space and therefore all live together despite their cultural differences. </p>

			<p>I am also a very, very active person who loves to go out and talk to people about their daily lives that are different from ours. That's why I often go to places that are a bit separated from the rest of the world because I think that's where you find the most different people and therefore the ones who can bring you the most.</p>

			<p>My favorite country in the world is the United States. I love the different cultures that are layered in Los Angeles or Miami, cities that I have been lucky enough to visit. But there is more to the United States than just these urban, cosmopolitan megalopolises. There are cities that are completely separate and purely American like Oklahoma City. The people there are extremely welcoming and like to receive people in their city.</p>

			<h2>💪SPORTS (LIFE)</h2>
			<p align=”justify”>I think sports is a big part of my life. My biggest passion is basketball, I get up at night to watch the games because of the time difference so it's detrimental to me but it's also what drives me and what I love doing. I share this passion with the basketball association at ESSEC where I had the opportunity to meet people who have the same passion as me and to talk about basketball with them.</p>

			<p align=”justify”>I love sports in general as well because it allows me to get rid of the frustration of my day and to turn to myself, paying attention to my body is part of my personal development and is therefore very important to me. Even if, in my opinion, team sports are the best sports, it is sometimes very interesting to do sports alone.</p>

			<p align=”justify”> Finally, some athletes inspire me in their way of being like the basketball player Russell Westbrook who has a resilience that I admire and envy.</p>

			<h2>VIDEO GAMES</h2>
			<p align=”justify”> Video games allow me to relax and to meet my friends online despite the distance that separates us since we all study in the 4 corners of France or even the world. I play all kinds of games, but especially sports games where I can show my competitiveness because I hate losing.</p>
			<h2>MY PERSONALITY</h2>
			</p>I am a hyperactive person, who likes to laugh and have fun. I am often the clown of the troupe and I love to make people around me laugh. But I am also a very empathetic person, I pay attention to the people around me and I can often understand the feeling of a person just by a few signs. I like to go out a lot but I feel very comfortable at home.</p>
